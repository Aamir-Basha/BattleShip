🚢 Battleship 🚀
Welcome to Battleship, a modern twist on the classic Battleship game! This project is something I built to showcase my C++ skills and have some fun while coding 🎮. If you're a fan of strategic games and want to see how C++ can bring a classic game to life, you're in the right place!

🌟 Features
Vortex Attacks: 🌪️ Add a new level of strategy with dangerous vortexes that affect multiple areas of the battlefield.
Dynamic Gameplay: Attack, defend, and adapt! Your success depends on how you use your resources and how well you predict your opponent's moves.
Sleek Code: Clean, modern C++17 code using some of the best practices, such as algorithm-based logic and lambdas 🔧.
Precision at its Core: 🧮 No more guessing games! Precision-driven calculations ensure every attack hits (or misses) exactly where it should.
🎯 How to Play
Clone the repo: Get the code and compile it on your machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/amer-basha/battleship.git
Build & Run:

bash
Copy code
cd battleship
cd src
cmake ..
make
./battleship
Gameplay: Use your strategy and vortex attacks to sink your opponent's ships before they sink yours! It's a mind game — outwit your enemies and claim victory 🏆.

💻 Tech Used
C++17: Modern C++ features like lambdas, algorithms, and STL containers for optimized and clean code.
CMake: Easily manage the build system across platforms 🛠️.
Why This Project?
I built this as part of my journey as a Computer Science student at TU Braunschweig 🏫. It reflects my interest in developing interactive applications while improving my problem-solving skills using C++. It's not just about coding — it's about creating something fun, playable, and challenging! 😄

🚀 Future Enhancements
I have plans to take Battleship Vortex to the next level, including:

Multiplayer Mode: Play against friends or AI opponents 🧑‍🤝‍🧑.
Improved UI: Make it visually more appealing with a polished interface 🎨.
More Game Modes: Add exciting variations to keep things interesting 💡.
