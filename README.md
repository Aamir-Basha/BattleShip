## Battleship 
Welcome to Battleship, a fun twist on the classic game! I created this project to show off my C++ skills while having a good time coding ðŸŽ®. If you enjoy strategic games, you're in the right place!

## Features
Vortex Attacks: Use vortexes to affect multiple battlefield areas.
Dynamic Gameplay: Attack and defend while adapting to your opponentâ€™s moves.
Clean Code: Written in modern C++17 with best practices for clarity.
Precision: Every attack is calculated accurately, no guessing involved! 
How to Play
Clone the Repo: Get the code and compile it:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/amer-basha/battleship.git
```
```bash
cd battleship/src
cmake ..
make
```
```bash 
./battleship
```
Gameplay: Use your strategy and vortex attacks to sink your opponent's ships before they sink yours

## Tech Used
C++17: Utilizes modern features for optimized code.
CMake: Manages the build system easily across platforms.
Why This Project?
I built this while studying Computer Science at TU Braunschweig. It reflects my interest in creating interactive applications and improving my problem-solving skills with C++. It's all about making something fun and challenging

## Future Enhancements
- I plan to expand Battleship with:
- Multiplayer Mode: Compete against friends or AI.
- Improved UI: Create a more appealing interface.
- More Game Modes: Add new variations to keep it exciting.
